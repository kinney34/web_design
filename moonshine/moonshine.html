        <p class='block-text'>Technically, 'moonshine' refers to any <strong>alcoholic</strong> beverage for which
          <strong>taxes</strong> have not been paid. In practice, it almost always means
          clear, unaged <strong>whiskey</strong> made from <strong>corn</strong> or <strong>sugar</strong>.

        <h1 class='block-title'>Early Days</h1>
        <p class='block-text'>Scots-Irish settlers brought whiskey distilling to America in the 1700's to supply
              a massive thirst for liquor. Colonials drank way more than modern Americans- mostly beer, cider, whiskey,
              wine, and brandy. Some was imported, but they quickly learned to brew and distill with what they had available.</p>

        <h1 class='block-title'>Changing With the Times</h1>
        <p class='block-text'>American drinking habits had to adapt early and often. In response to famine, a 1676 law
              limited the grain available for distilling, leading to an explosion in the popularity of rum made from Caribbean
              molasses. Later, cut off by the Revolutionary War from both molasses and imported booze, distillers made whiskey
              from corn, rye, and barley.</p>

        <h1 class='block-title'>The Whiskey Rebellion</h1>
        <p class='block-text'>After the Revolutionary War, the newly formed United States was awash in debt and liquor.
              The federal government decided to kill two birds with one stone by way of the 1791 Excise Act, the first ever tax on
              domestically distilled spirits. Outraged farmers and distillers refused to pay and even organized attacks on tax
              collectors until Washington sent federal troops to western Pennsylvania to put down the so-called 'Whiskey Rebellion.'
              The tax was repealed in 1802, and the government mostly stayed out of distillers' way for the next 60 years.

        <h1 class='block-title'>War on Whiskey</h1>
        <p class='block-text'>America's next adventure in moonshining came with the Civil War. Liquor was steeply taxed to fund the war
              and reconstruction, leading to a surge in illegal distilleries and subsequent enforcement efforts across the country.
              Federal agents led massive raids on immigrant neighborhoods in northern cities and revenuers trekked through the mountains
              looking for moonshiners in Appalachia. Illegal distilling was especially ubiquitous in the South, where the war had
              left many impoverished and resentful of the government.</p>
