    <h1>CHALLAH</h1>

  <div class='text-block history'>
    <p>Challah is a special bread in Jewish cuisine eaten on ceremonial occasions like Shabbat and other holidays (except Passover,
      when leavened bread is forbidden). During Shabbat (the Sabbath), people often serve two loaves of challah because in the book of
      Exodus, God commanded the Israelites to gather twice as much manna on Fridays so that they wouldn't have to gather any on the Sabbath.
      Traditionally, a small piece of dough is set aside as an offering during baking.

    <p class='book'>'Why is this dumb gentile talking about challah?', you may be asking. An excellent question! I read a fantastic book called
      <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Anya-Dragon-Sofiya-Pasternack/dp/0358006074'><i>Anya and the Dragon</i></a> about a 10th-century
      Russian Jewish girl trying to find a dragon in her village. It's a downright delightful story filled with magic, adventure, and,
      you guessed it, baking challah for Shabbat. After reading about this spunky little girl taking breaks from dragon hunting to
      knead challah dough, I was dying to try it out.

      <p class='recipe-title'>The Recipe</p>
      <p class='recipe-text'>Unlike everyday bread dough, challah dough is enriched with eggs, oil, and sugar, and some bakers add raisins, honey,
        sesame seeds, anise seeds, or poppy seeds. Most recipes I found used yeast to make the dough rise, but baker's yeast wasn't
        actually an option until about 150 years ago, so in the spirit of Anya, I decided to use a sourdough starter. Also it's 2020 and
        I hopped on the sourdough bandwagon back in April, so I already had a jar of starter feeling neglected in my fridge. Here's a link to the
        recipe I used: <br><br> <a href='https://thegingeredwhisk.com/sourdough-challa/'>Sourdough Challah</a></p>
      <br><br>
      <p class='recipe-title'>Step 1: Make the levain</p>
      <p class='recipe-text'>*Do this the night before you plan to bake- it needs time to rise!*</p>
      <ul>
        <li>113g well-fed, active sourdough starter</li>
        <li>113g warm water</li>
        <li>226g bread flour</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <ol>
        <li>Mix the starter, water, and flour together in a medium mixing bowl. You might have to knead a bit to get it all combined.</li>
        <li>Cover the bowl with a lid or plastic wrap and let it sit at room temperature overnight (8-12 hours).</li>
      </ol>
      <br><br>
      <p class='recipe-title'>Step 2: Make the dough</p>
      <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup warm water</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>3 tbsp honey OR 1/3 cup sugar</li>
        <li>about 3 cups bread flour</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the water, eggs, salt, oil, and honey (or sugar) until the salt is dissolved.</li>
        <li>With your hands or a wooden spoon, mix in the bread flour all at once.</li>
        <li>Once the flour is mostly combined, dump the dough out on a lightly floured countertop.</li>
        <li>Add the levain you made last night and knead until the dough is smooth (about 10 minutes by hand). Add a tablespoon or two
          of water if the dough is too stiff to work with, and a tablespoon or two of flour if it's too wet.</li>
        <li>Put the dough in a clean, oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let it ferment for about 2 hours. It probably won't
          rise much.</li>
      </ol>
      <br><br>
      <p class='recipe-title'>Step 3: Shape the dough</p>
      <p class='recipe-text'>Okay, so you have a lot of options here. A <i>brief</i> Google search dug up 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 12 stranded braids, round braids,
        rolls, twists, knots, flowers, and keys. You could make a menorah if you're really ambitious or one big ball if you're
        really not. Here are some step-by-step guides that I found helpful:<br><br>

        Whatever you decide, I highly recommend watching some videos of challah braiding if you've got some to kill. Very relaxing.</p>

      <p class='recipe-title'>Step 4: Proof the dough</p>
      <p class='recipe-text'>Put your shaped dough on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and cover it with plastic wrap. Let it rise until tripled in size.
        This should take about 5 hours, but it depends on the temperature and humidity in your kitchen. Watch the dough rather than the clock;
        it's ready when you can gently poke it and the dough springs back.</p>

      <p class='recipe-title'>Step 5: Bake!</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350&deg;</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, beat an egg with a pinch of salt.</li>
        <li>Brush the egg wash over the dough.</li>
        <li>Bake the dough until well browned. Rotate the pan halfway through so it browns evenly and lightly cover with foil
          if it's getting too dark. The baking time will vary based on how you shaped the dough; I went with a 4-strand braid and
          it took about 40 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once the bread is out of the oven, take it off the baking sheet and let it cool COMPLETELY on a wire rack. This is important:
          the bread is still baking on the inside, so if you cut into it before it's cool it will be doughy and sad. I know it's hard. I
          believe in you.</li>
